        <div id="tribute-info">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early Life:</strong>Sehwag was born into a Jat family to a grain merchant father. He first attended Arora Vidya School and later finished his graduation from Jamia Milia Islamia. His interest in cricket reportedly developed when he was gifted a toy bat, though he was just seven months old then. He later convinced his parents to allow him play the game, as he wasn t inclined towards studies.</li>
                <li><strong>First-Class debut:</strong>Sehwag made his First-Class debut against Tamil Nadu in February 1998 in Chennai. His maiden First-Class victim was former India player WV Raman. He didn t get a chance to bat in the game that turned out to be his only First-Class match that season.</li>
                <li><strong>India debut:</strong> He made his One-Day International (ODI) debut against Pakistan in April 1999. It didn t go the way he would have wanted it to, as he got out just for a single run and went for 35 runs in his three overs. He was dropped after the nightmarish debut and had to wait for a year and a half before getting his next game. But the turning point in his career came in his fourth ODI, where his Man of the Match effort (58 runs and three wickets) helped India beat Australia. A shoulder injury ruled him out from the remainder of the series.</li>
                <li><strong>Hundred on Test debut:</strong> After an impressive start to his ODI career, Sehwag made his Test debut against South Africa at Bloemfontein in November 2001. Batting at No.6, he scored a hundred on his debut and added 220 runs with Sachin Tendulkar for the fifth wicket. He scored 105 runs in the first innings and 31 in the second. But his effort wasn t enough to avoid India s defeat.</li>
                <li><strong>MCG special:</strong> In December 2003 at the epic Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), Sehwag produced one of the greatest innings on the opening day of a Test match. He scored a majestic 233-ball 195 against Australia in no time. Even before the Australians could take the new ball, Sehwag was gone after plundering one of the greatest knock by an Indian, falling just short of his first Test double-century.</li>
                <li><strong>Multan ka Sultan:</strong> In April 2004 during India s historic tour of Pakistan, Sehwag became India’s first and only triple-centurion in Test cricket in Multan. His 309 runs that came during his almost nine hour stay at the wicket helped India win the first Test by an innings margin. During his illustrious career, he got quite a few titles. He s famously known as Nazafgarh ka Nawab and Multan Ka Sultan for his on-field heroics.</li>
                <li><strong>Selfless player:</strong> Sehwag is often called as the selfless player. His acts on the field justify the tag. Never the one to play for records, Sehwag would hit a ball irrespective of his score. He brought his triple and double hundreds risking his wicket by hitting a six. Even if he would get out, he would never mind. He also famously declined singles during his carry-the-bat effort in Galle, when he was batting on 199 with the last man, just in the interests of the team.</li>
                <li><strong>Fastest Indian ODI hundred (record later broken by Virat Kohli):</strong>  In March 2009, Sehwag blasted a 60-ball hundred against New Zealand at Hamilton. It was the then Indian record for the fastest ODI hundred as he bettered Mohammad Azharuddin s effort of century in 62 balls. Virat Kohli who scored a century off just 52 balls against Australia at Jaipur in 2013 later broke the record.</li>
                <li><strong>“Beta beta hota hai, baap baap hota hai”:</strong> This is what Sehwag once famously told Shoaib Akhtar when Tendulkar hooked him for a six. The legend goes like this: Shoaib Akhtar challenges Sehwag to hit his bouncer and the latter asks him to bowl one to his daddy Tendulkar, who was batting at the other end. Shoaib does bowl one, only to be hooked for a six by the master, post which Sehwag spoke those golden words.</li>
                <li><strong>The 26 run-over: </strong>Sehwag smashed six boundaries in an over once during the Indian Oil Cup final in 2006 at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. Chasing a target of 282, he thrashed Dilhara Fernando for 4,4,6,4,4,4 (a total of 26 runs) in an over.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Retired leagues:</em> Post international retirement, Sehwag played in the league of retired cricketers. He played alongside the likes of Wasim Akram, Sachin Tendulkar, Shane Warne, Sourav Ganguly, Ricky Ponting, Jacques Kallis, Curtly Ambrose and others in the All-Stars series in the United States. He also led a side in the Masters Cricket League (MCL) in 2016</strong></li>
